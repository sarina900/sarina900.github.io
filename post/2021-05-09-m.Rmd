##Here is my post

#Using R studio and Python together is fun
*Does the names Python and R next to next other sound scary? That is what I thought when I first heard them together but, the more I leaned about them the easier it got. Each of them have their own special features and being able to use them together makes things better.  *

```{R}
library(reticulate)
something <-"This is my name:"
ag<- "My age is"
```

```{python}
first="sarina"
last="Khajeharzani"
age=20+3

print(r.something,first + last)
print(r.ag,age)
```
